Code Louisville 2020 Python Data Visualization Mapping

I make maps for a living, and am very interested in combining Census data with road data in order to see and visualize how cut off roads and one-way streets have contributed to our segregated city today. 

This got me interested in commute times. In a city like Louisville where we don't have any major transit or bike networks, commute to work is literally how people decide where to live. 

For this class, I am writing a very basic start to a larger idea of scrubbing social media. 

I want to eventually put this "Commute Calculator" on a webpage that I can use what I learned in the Front End Development Course to make a linkable,educational page.
