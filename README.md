Code Louisville 2020 Python Commute Calculator and (Future) Maps

I make maps for a living, and am very interested in combining Census data with road data in order to see and visualize how cut off roads and one-way streets have contributed to our segregated city today. 

This got me interested in commute times. In a city like Louisville where we don't have any major transit or bike networks, commute to work is literally how people decide where to live. 

For this class, I am writing a very basic start to a larger idea of scrubbing social media for commute times using Tweepy.


BASIC VERSION (Graded for Code Louisville)


YOU WILL NEED TO IMPORT:
import datetime
import math

Python Class Requirements:

1.Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (I will be converting user input commute time in minutes to hours to days)

2.Calculate and display data based on an external factor 

3.Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data



INTERMEDIATE (NOT FOR CODE LOUISVILLE, LATER DATE)

Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display

Implement a “scraper” that can be fed a type of file or URL and pull information off of it. For example, a web scraper that lets you provide any website URL and it will find certain keywords on the page

#Map Data Google Maps KSV Export
#Tweepy and pandas using keyword "commute"
