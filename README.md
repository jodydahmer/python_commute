Code Louisville 2020 Python Data Visualization Mapping

I make maps for a living, and am very interested in combining Census data with road data in order to see and visualize how cut off roads and one-way streets have contributed to our segregated city today. 

This got me interested in commute times. In a city like Louisville where we don't have any major transit or bike networks, commute to work is literally how people decide where to live. 

For this class, I am writing a very basic start to a larger idea of scrubbing social media. 

I want to eventually put this "Commute Calculator" on a webpage that I can use what I learned in the Front End Development Course to make a linkable,educational page.



BASIC VERSION

This will ask the user input questions about their commute, calculate different times based on days and years spent commuting, then compare their input commute time to city averages stored in lists. 

YOU WILL NEED TO IMPORT:
import os
import datetime
import re

Python Class Requirements:

1.Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)

2.Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)


3.Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

4.Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data

5.Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file


INTERMEDIATE (NOT FOR CODE LOUISVILLE, LATER DATE)

Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display

Implement a “scraper” that can be fed a type of file or URL and pull information off of it. For example, a web scraper that lets you provide any website URL and it will find certain keywords on the page
